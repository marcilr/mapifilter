Wow, looks very promising for moving messages:

IMAPIFolder.c:480
/**
   \details Copy or Move a message from a folder to another

   \param obj_src The source folder
   \param obj_dst The destination folder
   \param message_id pointer to container object for message ids.
   \param WantCopy boolean value, defines whether the operation is a
   copy or a move

   Possible values for WantCopy:
   -# 0: Move
   -# 1: Copy

   \return MAPI_E_SUCCESS on success, otherwise MAPI error.

   \note Developers may also call GetLastError() to retrieve the last
   MAPI error code. Possible MAPI error codes are:
   - MAPI_E_NOT_INITIALIZED: MAPI subsystem has not been initialized
   - MAPI_E_CALL_FAILED: A network problem was encountered during the
     transaction

   \sa OpenFolder, GetLastError
