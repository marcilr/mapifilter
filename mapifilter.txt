MAPI Filter


Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is a messaging
architecture and a Component Object Model based API for Microsoft
Windows. MAPI allows client programs to become (e-mail)
messaging-enabled, -aware, or -based by calling MAPI subsystem
routines that interface with certain messaging servers.  While
MAPI is designed to be independent of the protocol, it is usually
used with MAPI/RPC, the proprietary protocol that Microsoft
Outlook uses to communicate with Microsoft Exchange.
